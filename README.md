# Power-System-State-Estimation-with-PMU-Phasor-Measurement-Unit-
Power System State Estimation with PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) uses WLS with PMU to estimate Voltage magnitude and angle of a system. The code also compares the values with respect to the states obtained using Newton Raphson method.
